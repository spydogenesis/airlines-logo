# Airlines Logo Collection

A comprehensive collection of airline logos organized by IATA (International Air Transport Association) codes. This repository provides high-quality airline logos in multiple sizes and versions.

## Usage

You can access the logos directly through jsDelivr CDN. Use the following URL pattern:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/spydogenesis/airlines-logo@latest/airlines-logo/[SIZE]/[IATA_CODE].png
```

Example:
```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/spydogenesis/airlines-logo@latest/airlines-logo/200x200_v2/WT.png
```

## Available Sizes

- 200x200 (Original version)
- 200x200_v2 (Updated version)

## ICAO-IATA Mapping

The repository includes an `icao-iata-mapping.json` file that maps ICAO (International Civil Aviation Organization) codes to IATA codes. This is useful when you need to convert between the two code systems.

Example mapping:
```json
{
  "SWT": "WT",  // ICAO: SWT, IATA: WT
  "UAL": "UA",  // ICAO: UAL, IATA: UA
  "BAW": "BA"   // ICAO: BAW, IATA: BA
}
```
